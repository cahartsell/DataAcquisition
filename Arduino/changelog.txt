Baja14_v2
	-Rewrote previous year code to be more efficient
	-Working Speedometer


Baja14_v2.1
	-Changed Speedometer from numerical readout to sliding bar gauge
	-Added displayMPH function (seperated display functionality from main loop)
	-Modified some areas for easier readability/compactness


Baja_v2.2
	-Added Accelerometer and SD Logger functionality
	-Added additional comments and section divisions
	-Changed I/O pin declarations from 'int' to 'static int'
		-using #define on I/O pins caused errors when compiling

	-Added Engine RPM functionality
	-Renamed from Baja14_v2.2 to Baja_v2.2
	-Changed speed, engineRPM, and interrupt variables from unsigned int to unsigned long integer variables
		-Fixed out-of-range bug in Engine RPM calculation by using long int

	-Used fixed point math in place of floating point calculations for speed and RPM
		-Should improve execution speed (& possibly reliability)
		-scaled Speed and RPM variables are upscaled by a factor of 1000


Baja_V2.3
	-Commented out Accelerometer Code section since it is not currently used
	-Revised initial Serial messages
	-Added logData function to organize data logging functionality into one place
		-Removed various Serial.print() statements previously used troughout program to log data

Baja_V2.4
	-Added display functions:
		-displayRPM function (sliding bar for Engine RPM similar to displayMPH)
		-displayPlainText function to display Speed and RPM 
	-Added ability to switch between display modes by pressing LEFT or RIGHT LCD buttons

Baja_V2.3_TEST
	-Revised axle and engine RPM calculation methods
